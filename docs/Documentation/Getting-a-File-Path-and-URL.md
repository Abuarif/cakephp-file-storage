# Getting a file path and URL

The path and filename of a stored file in the storage backend that was used to store the file is generated by a [path builder](Path-Builders.md). The event listener that stored your file has used a path builder to generate the path based on the entity data. This means that if you have the entity and instantiate a path builder you can build the path to it in any place.

The plugin already provides you with several convenience short cuts to do that.

Be aware that whenever you use a path builder somewhere, you **must** use the same path builder and options as when the entity was created. They're usually the same as configured in your event listener.
